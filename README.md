## Project Status

⚠️ **Archived / Design-Phase Prototype**

Opstimus is currently archived and not under active development.

This repository represents an early-stage architectural prototype created during the **VPBank x AWS Hackathon 2025**. The primary goal was to explore system design, cloud-native architecture, and end-to-end workflow composition rather than to deliver a fully completed product.

While the implementation is partial, the repository remains public as a reference for:
- system architecture design
- AWS-based pipeline composition
- operational analytics concepts

Future development may revisit this project with a reduced scope or alternative technology stack.
